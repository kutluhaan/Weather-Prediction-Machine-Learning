‚òÄÔ∏è Weather Prediction with Machine Learning
üìù What's This All About?
Hey there! This project is a machine learning notebook focused on predicting weather in Australia. The goal was to take a dataset and see which machine learning algorithms could do the best job of predicting future weather. We've explored a bunch of different models like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees, and then compared their performance using various metrics to find the most accurate one!

üöÄ What Can It Do?
Weather Prediction: Predict whether it will rain tomorrow in Australia based on a variety of weather data.

Multiple Algorithms: It shows you how to use different machine learning models to solve the same problem.

Performance Comparison: We've used a few different error rate methods like Jaccard Index, F1 Score, and Log Loss to compare how well each model performed.

Data Preprocessing: The notebook includes steps for cleaning and preparing the data, which is a super important part of any machine learning project.

‚öôÔ∏è What's Under the Hood?
This project is a Jupyter Notebook and uses a few standard Python libraries for machine learning.

Pandas: For handling all the data and getting it ready for our models.

Numpy: A must-have for all the numerical and mathematical operations.

Scikit-learn (sklearn): This is the main library for all the machine learning models and metrics we've used! It's got everything from Logistic Regression to SVM and all the evaluation tools.

Matplotlib: For creating any visualizations to help understand the data.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Get Started
Since this is a Jupyter Notebook, it's pretty easy to get it up and running.

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/kutluhaan/Weather-Prediction-Machine-Learning.git
cd Weather-Prediction-Machine-Learning

Install Jupyter:
If you don't have it installed already, you can get it with pip.

pip install jupyter

Install the dependencies:
You'll need a few other libraries to run the notebook.

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook "Weather Prediction.ipynb"

This will open a browser window, and you can then click on the file to open the notebook and run all the cells.

üìä What It Looks Like!
(You could add a screenshot here of one of the data tables or a chart from your Jupyter Notebook to show a quick glimpse of the analysis!)

Example:

üôè A Big Thank You!
IBM Developer Skills Network: For providing the dataset and the environment to run the lab in the browser.

Scikit-learn: For their fantastic and easy-to-use machine learning library!
