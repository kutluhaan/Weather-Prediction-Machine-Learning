# Weather-Prediction-Machine-Learning

It is a machine learning project for the prediction of weather in Australia. In this Jupyter Notebook, I have used various prediction algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree and I have used various error rate methods such as Jaccard Index, F1 Score, R2 Score and Log Loss.
